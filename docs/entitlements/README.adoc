There are several scenarios in which you can perform Tekton builds using Openshift Pipelines, but your Insights operator is not able to sync the entitlements. For example:

* The Insights operator is disabled.
* SCA (Simple Content Access) is not enabled in your organization.
* There is a Firewall outside the OCP cluster blocking Insights communication.
* etc.

In such cases, you can use the following procedure that consists of two steps: 1) Generating the certificates; and 2) Adding them to your cluster.


== Create the certificates


First, access http://access.redhat.com/management and, in the *Systems* tab, create a new system. You can use the values that I filled in the following screenshot.

.Create a System in the management console
image::entitlements-01.png["Create a System in the management console", width=100%]

Second, access the *Subscriptions* section of the system to attach one of your subscriptions:

.Click on Subscriptions > Attach Subscriptions
image::entitlements-02.png["Attach Subscriptions", width=100%]

In my case, I will use an Employee sub, but you might want to use several subscriptions, depending on the repositories that you may want to access to: 

.Select one or several subscriptions
image::entitlements-03.png["Select one or several subscriptions", width=100%]

Now, you will be able to 

.Select one or several subscriptions
image::entitlements-04.png["Select one or several subscriptions", width=100%]

== Add the certificates to Openshift

Once the certificates are downloaded and extracted, you will find them inside a path like this:

[source, console]
----
XXXXXX_certificates/consumer_export/export/entitlement_certificates/XXXXXX.pem
----

Inside the `.pem` file you will have the contents of both fields of the secret:

[source, console]
----
$ cat XXXXXX.pem | grep "\-"
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN ENTITLEMENT DATA-----
-----END ENTITLEMENT DATA-----
-----BEGIN RSA SIGNATURE-----
-----END RSA SIGNATURE-----
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
----

Make sure to split it in two according to the following rule:

* `entitlement-key.pem` contains the *PRIVATE KEY*.
* `entitlement.pem` contains *CERTIFICATE* + *ENTITLEMENT DATA* + *RSA SIGNATURE*.

Now, you can create the secret as follows:

[source, bash]
----
oc create secret generic etc-pki-entitlement -n pipelines \
    --from-file=secrets/entitlement-key.pem --from-file=secrets/entitlement.pem
----


Now, when you run the entitlements build, you will see the following in the Buildah logs:

[source, console]
----
