= Run Tekton Pipelines on Quay Image Mirroring Notifications

In this section, we are going to explore the proposal by siamaksade in https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/keep-your-applications-secure-with-automatic-rebuilds[Red Hat's Blog: Keep Your Applications Secure With Automatic Rebuilds] and in his GitHub repository https://github.com/siamaksade/quay-mirror-pipeline[quay-mirror-pipeline].


NOTE: For this section, I have heavily used the utils provided by *lbohnsac* in his GitHub repository https://github.com/lbohnsac/quay-api[quay-api].


The idea is to create a mirror repository in your Quay organization that syncs repository tags every day and generates push notifications to Openshift Pipelines that will build a new image and push it to the final repository. Therefore, these will be the repositories:

* `ubi8/ubi`: This is the upstream images repository.
* `alopezme/ubi8-mirror`: This repository is located in my Quay instance/org and simply mirrors upstream images and generates notifications every time a new image is stored.
* `alopezme/kustomize`: This repository contains the final built image with the `kustomize` binary.

== Configure Quay repository

First, create a new repository that will mirror the content of the RH official registry:

Create a Robot Account with the following access to both repositories:

Set up notifications on push:
